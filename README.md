# Spider-Maze
Commodore 64 arcade maze game for Scene World issue 29

Spider Maze is a fun maze game which was written as part of a tutorial game for Scene World 29 disk mag. This version of this code is the full game version (not the tutorial version. All assembly source is combined as one file.

The Spider Maze project also consists of all of the game graphics and music data. All graphics have been saved as raw binary format, and the game music and jingles have been saved as .PRG format. Should you wish to transform the music to a work tune, you will need the SID2SNG command line apllication. 

# What's it all about?
