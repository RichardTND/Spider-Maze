# Spider-Maze
Commodore 64 arcade maze game for Scene World issue 29

Spider Maze is a fun maze game which was written as part of a tutorial game for Scene World 29. This version of the code is for the full game, rather than the small cut down tutorial version. 

The following cross assembly tools required for this project are as follows:

ESSENTIAL:
* IDE text editing software that can handle code
* Kick Assembler V4 (or higher) Note that you will need JAVA installed onto your PC
* Exomizer V3.1.1
* VICE V2.4 (or highter)

Have fun.
