# Spider-Maze
Commodore 64 arcade maze game for Scene World issue 29

Spider Maze is a fun maze game which was written as part of a tutorial game for Scene World 29. This version of the code is for the full game, rather than the small cut down tutorial version. You are Fred the ball, who has entered a maze full of crystals. The object of the game is to help him pick up all of the crystals before the spiders catch him and eat him alive. 

The following cross assembly tools required for this project are as follows:

ESSENTIAL:
* IDE text editing software that can handle code and running Batch files. Notepad ++ is a good example that can handle this.
* Kick Assembler V4 (or higher) Note that you will need JAVA installed onto your PC
* Exomizer V3.1.1
* VICE V2.4 (or highter)

OPTIONAL:
* Charpad V2.0 (or higher) - Use this to view example levels.
* Spritepad V2.0 (or higher) - Use this to view/edit game sprites
* Goat Tracker V2.75 (or higher)

Have fun.
